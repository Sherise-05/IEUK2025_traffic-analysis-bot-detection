# IEUK2025_traffic-analysis-bot-detection

## Project Overview
This project investigates abnormal traffic patterns in a sample server log file for a small media startup. The goal is to identify signs of bot or abusive behavior and recommend a cost-effective strategy to mitigate server overload caused by non-human traffic.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ log_analyzer.py # Main Python script for log parsing and analysis
â”œâ”€â”€ sample-log.log # Provided log file 
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ report.md # 300-word written summary of findings
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md # This documentation file
```

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Script

### 1. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Run the log analysis
```
python log_analyzer.py
```

### The script will print:
- Top 5 most active IPs
- Top 5 requested endpoints
- Suspicious IPs (e.g. frequent 404s or POSTs)
- IPs exceeding rate limits (e.g. >5 requests/second)

## Features
- Log parsing using regular expressions
- IP and endpoint frequency tracking
- Basic bot detection (404s, high-frequency POSTs)
- Rate-limiting detection logic
- Cost-effective mitigation recommendations

## Assumptions
The company uses a basic web server stack (e.g. NGINX or Apache)
No advanced firewall, CDN, or bot management system is currently in place

This project was created for learning purposes during the Bright Network IEUK 2025 internship and is not licensed for commercial use.
